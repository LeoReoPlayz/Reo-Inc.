                <h3>Reo Inc. website</h3>
                <p>This project that as been 1 month in development, is built on HTML, CSS, and Java. The website, still in its developmental phase, houses a variety of content and features tailored for Leo's interests and endeavors. As the project evolves, expect to find sections dedicated to Leo's coding projects, music, and a detailed exploration of Leo's identity. Each section is carefully curated to showcase Leo's talents, achievements, and artistic expressions. As of now, the website is a work in progress. The development team has been actively working for a month to bring this vision to life, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience for visitors.

                <h3>Python Pacman Recreation</h3>
                <p>This great project is built using python, it's a great famous game originally released in 1980 and was found playable on arcades. In Pacman, players control a yellow, circular character named Pac-Man as it moves through a maze filled with dots or pellets. The objective is to eat all the dots in the maze while avoiding four colorful ghostsâ€”Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The maze also contains larger, flashing dots known as power pellets, which temporarily empower Pac-Man to turn the tables and eat the ghosts. Each ghost has its own distinct behavior, making the game both challenging and strategic. Now, imagine that 1980s game made for PC! Yes, it's downloadable, containing ZERO viruses and malware. </p>
